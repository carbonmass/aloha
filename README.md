# Aloha Apparel Co. Website

### This is a single-page website for a fictional clothing company. It's my first website project at the Red Academy.

## I used the following to build this website:

- ### HTML
        In HTML, I have created a separate section for the different parts of the website, in which there are many divs with appropriately named classes.

        I have also used unordered lists to put together similar items (for example the Nav bar).

- ### CSS
        In CSS, I have made use of the many classes created in HTML to style the website. 

        I have used the Mobile First strategy to create a mobile friendly website, and then created media queries at minimum width of 600px (tablet) and 1240px (desktop)to ensure the responsiveness of the website on different devices.

- ### JavaScript

        In JavaScript, I used the flickity carousel plugin to style the featured products. 

        I also created an Event Listener that would prevent the submit button to take user to a different page, and instead accept an input (email address) in the correct format, and if it is not in the correct format, it would alert.
